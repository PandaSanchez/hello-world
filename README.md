# hello-world
I am a technical digital marketing analyst, an aspiring Pythonista and wannabe data engineer. My goal is to become proficient in Python (and SQL) to build and prototype new backend products or platforms with other like-minded collaborators. Particular industry data sets of interest include film, music, art and video games.
